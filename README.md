# 100_days
100 days of coding problems and challenges that I have found from across the internet. The goal is to create a habit of coding and showcasing knowledge across a few programming languages. I want to use Python, Javascript, and C++ to do this challenge. For Javascript, the goal was to also use the Document Object Model, so I used HTML files as well. 

These aren't going to be incredibly difficult challenges. They are more meant to give me experience in those languages and to create a daily habit.

At least, that was the original goal. Life did get in the way, and I did have to skip a few days. But I do plan on making at least 100 days of coding this year.

Day 1: Hello World challenge. Simply create programs that print out 'hello world' to the console.

Day 2: Adding three numbers together

Day 3: converting minutes to seconds

Day 4: saying happy birthday to a person

Day 5: Programming a countdown from 5 to 1

Day 6: Take a number and tells whether it is odd or even

Day 7: whether a number is a multiple of 3 or 5 or both

Day 8: The Fibonacci sequence.

Day 9: The prime factors of a number

Day 10: ASCII Art of my initials

Day 11: Calculating celcius from fahrenheit, and vice versa

Day 12: Calculating the average of a class

Day 13: Printing the shape of an hourglass in C++
