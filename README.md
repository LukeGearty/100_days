# 100_days
100 days of coding problems and challenges that I have found from across the internet. The goal is to create a habit of coding and showcasing knowledge across a few programming languages. I want to use Python, Javascript, and C++ to do this challenge.

These aren't going to be incredibly difficult challenges. They are more meant to give me experience in those languages and to create a daily habit.

Day 1: Hello World challenge. Simply create programs that print out 'hello world' to the console.
Day 2: Adding three numbers together
Day 3: converting minutes to seconds
Day 4: saying happy birthday to a person
Day 5: Programming a countdown from 5 to 1
